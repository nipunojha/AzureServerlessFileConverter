# AzureServerlessFileConverter
Use Azure Functions and Graph API to convert file between different supported formats 
-Coded to download uploaded file as pdf using session upload which can handle large size files

-Can be exteded  based on the formats supported by the graph api - glb, jpg, html
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/api/driveitem_get_content_format?view=odsp-graph-online
-File formats tested: doc, ppt, excel, txt to pdf
-Used fsutil to generate files for large size so format could not be verifed
-Tested using postman to upload and download file
-Loved using graph explorer to get the clientid/secrets etc https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer

Challenges faced:
-figuring out tenant id, client id/secrets etc for the first time
-assigning api permissions (needed admin access)

-not sure about handing potentially infected files (security with using sharepoint/onedrive as upload folder), cost, clean up of abandoned/failed uploads (try/catch/finally maybe?)
-performance was slow but could be due to free tier/using consumption plan for function

Future/todo:
-extend to use cognitive-services for text summarization, key phrase and named entity recognition

-integration potential for HealthCare to summarize or categorize patient data/charts etc, PII detection

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/personally-identifiable-information/overview
-based on key phrase or named entity recognition using cognitive-services trigger notification alerts

-potentially use for translation?
